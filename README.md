# A_walk_in_the_park

A_walk_in_the_park is a text adventure/RPG that is mainly built to practice coding; however,
it is also decided to be a creative writing outlet.

The main storyline is set at Trailhead Springs Wilderness where the player is on a hike
in the wilderness. They can solve puzzles and do mini quests while interacting with the environment.  

Still much todo..
